# FreeHandDraw - Program to draw lines of interest on Norpix sequences

This script sets the coordinates that can be used by Bresenhams line 
algorithm in order to create a space-time image (STI) from a Norpix
StreamPix sequence file. The saved text file will contain information 
needed in the "STI generation" script (STI_generation_parallel_ver5_SEQ.m).

# STI_gneration - Program to create STI from Norpix sequences

This script uses line coordinates from FreeHandDraw to create a 
space-time image (STI) from a Norpix sequence. It uses Bresenhams 
algorithm and the parpool argument to use all avalable processor cores.

# Cell Visit Survey - Program for honey bee behavioural studies

This GUI detects cell visits (events) on a space-time image (STI) with a variety of filters. Manual and automated classifications, using VGG16 as convolutional neural network, are possible with option of viewing the corresponding AVI or SEQ file.
